# Deep-reinforcement-learning-for-finance-

## Overview

This project implements a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach in the context of financial trading. The goal is to train an agent to make trading decisions based on historical financial data. The implementation leverages deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm.

## Project Structure

### Imports & Initializations

The project begins with the necessary imports and initializations. Key libraries include PyTorch for deep learning, pandas for data manipulation, and numpy for numerical operations. The project uses LSTM networks to model time series data.

### LSTM Model

An LSTM model is defined as the core architecture for learning temporal dependencies in financial time series data. The model consists of an LSTM layer followed by a fully connected layer for predicting the output.

### Time Series Features

Functions for converting dataframes to numpy arrays and normalizing factors data are provided. Rolling statistics features such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum are computed for different window sizes, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant information from the data.

### State Design

The state design involves creating states based on dates and previous actions. Time series features, rolling statistics, and previous actions are combined to form the state representation for the agent.

### DDPG Implementation

The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is implemented using PyTorch. The project utilizes an existing implementation for DDPG ([GitHub - pytorch-DDPG](https://github.com/blackredscarf/pytorch-DDPG)). The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is employed for exploration noise.

### Memory Buffer

A memory buffer is implemented to store and sample experiences for training the DDPG agent. The buffer helps stabilize learning by providing a diverse set of experiences.

### Critic and Actor Networks

The Critic and Actor networks define the architectures for evaluating the Q-function and policy, respectively. The Critic network incorporates the LSTM model for processing time series features.

### Trainer

The Trainer class orchestrates the training process. It includes functions for exploration and exploitation, optimization of the Critic and Actor networks, and saving/loading models.

### Reward Function

The reward function calculates the reward based on the portfolio's performance, tracking error, and turnover.

### Training

The training phase involves iterating through episodes and steps, updating the agent's weights, and optimizing the model. The project supports model checkpointing and loading for continued training.

### Submission

The final part of the project involves using the trained model to generate trading decisions for a submission. The chosen model is loaded, and actions are determined for each time step. The resulting weights are then used to create the final submission.

## Instructions

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed (`pip install torch pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`).
2. Run the provided code for training the DDPG agent in the financial environment.
3. Use the trained model to generate trading decisions for the final submission.

Note: Adjust hyperparameters and configurations as needed for specific requirements or datasets.
